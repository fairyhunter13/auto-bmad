# Scope Management Command

This command allows you to set, check, or clear the scope for this conversation session.
Using inline scope is the **parallel-safe** way to work with multiple scopes simultaneously.

<scope-command>

## Parse Command Arguments

Check what the user is requesting:

## `/scope` (no arguments) - Show Current Scope

Display the current scope status:

```
**Current Scope Status:**
- Conversation scope: {scope} (or "not set")
- .bmad-scope file: {file_scope} (or "not found")
- Warning: .bmad-scope is shared across sessions - not parallel-safe!
```

## `/scope <scope-id>` - Set Scope for Conversation

Example: `/scope auth`, `/scope payment-v2`

1. Validate scope-id matches pattern: alphanumeric with hyphens
2. Check if scope exists in `{project-root}/_bmad/_config/scopes.yaml`
3. If scope doesn't exist, ask: "Scope '{scope-id}' not found. Create it? (y/n)"
4. Store {scope} = scope-id for this conversation
5. Calculate scope paths:
   - {scope_path} = _bmad-output/{scope}
   - {planning_artifacts} = {scope_path}/planning-artifacts
   - {implementation_artifacts} = {scope_path}/implementation-artifacts
   - {scope_tests} = {scope_path}/tests
6. Echo confirmation:

   ```
   **[SCOPE: {scope}]** Scope set for this conversation.

   All subsequent commands will use this scope:
   - Planning artifacts: {planning_artifacts}
   - Implementation artifacts: {implementation_artifacts}
   - Tests: {scope_tests}

   This scope will persist for this conversation only (parallel-safe).
   To use a different scope in another window, run `/scope <other-scope>` there.
   ```

## `/scope --clear` or `/scope clear` - Clear Scope

1. Clear {scope} from conversation memory
2. Echo:

   ```
   **[NO SCOPE]** Scope cleared for this conversation.

   Subsequent commands will:
   - Fall back to .bmad-scope file (if exists)
   - Or run without scope isolation
   ```

## `/scope --list` or `/scope list` - List Available Scopes

1. Load `{project-root}/_bmad/_config/scopes.yaml`
2. Display all scopes:

   ```
   **Available Scopes:**
   - auth (active in .bmad-scope)
   - payments
   - notifications
   - user-profile

   Use `/scope <name>` to set scope for this conversation.
   Use `/scope --create <name>` to create a new scope.
   ```

## `/scope --create <name>` or `/scope create <name>` - Create New Scope

1. Validate name matches pattern
2. Check scope doesn't already exist
3. Create scope directory structure:
   - _bmad-output/{name}/
   - _bmad-output/{name}/planning-artifacts/
   - _bmad-output/{name}/implementation-artifacts/
   - _bmad-output/{name}/tests/
4. Add to scopes.yaml
5. Optionally set as conversation scope
6. Echo confirmation

## `/scope --info` or `/scope info` - Show Detailed Scope Info

Display comprehensive scope information:

```
**Scope System Information:**

Current State:
- Conversation scope: {scope}
- .bmad-scope file scope: {file_scope}
- Effective scope: {effective} (conversation takes priority)

Scope Paths (when scope is active):
- Base: _bmad-output/{scope}/
- Planning: {planning_artifacts}
- Implementation: {implementation_artifacts}
- Tests: {scope_tests}

Parallel Execution:
- Conversation scope: PARALLEL-SAFE (isolated per window)
- .bmad-scope file: NOT parallel-safe (shared)
- Recommendation: Use `/scope <name>` or `--scope` flag for parallel work
```

</scope-command>

## Parallel Execution Guide

When working on multiple scopes simultaneously (e.g., in different IDE windows):

**DO:**

- Use `/scope auth` at the start of each conversation to set the scope
- Or pass `--scope auth` to each command: `/workflow-prd --scope auth`
- Each window maintains its own conversation scope

**DON'T:**

- Rely on `.bmad-scope` file for parallel work (it's shared!)
- Assume scope persists across conversation resets

**Example - Two Windows Working in Parallel:**

```
# Window 1:
/scope auth
/agent-pm
> CP (Create PRD)
# PRD goes to _bmad-output/auth/planning-artifacts/

# Window 2:
/scope payments
/agent-pm
> CP (Create PRD)
# PRD goes to _bmad-output/payments/planning-artifacts/
```
