# TEA Knowledge Fragment Index
# =============================
# All fragments are LANGUAGE-AGNOSTIC - principles apply to any language/framework.
# TEA will fetch latest framework-specific syntax via real-time web search.
#
# Detection files (in detection/):
#   - language-hints.yaml: Language/framework detection patterns + monorepo detection
#
# Usage:
#   1. TEA detects language/framework from codebase (Step 0-1)
#   2. TEA fetches latest docs with NOW() timestamp (Step 2)
#   3. TEA loads relevant knowledge fragments based on task
#   4. TEA applies universal principles + fetched framework syntax
