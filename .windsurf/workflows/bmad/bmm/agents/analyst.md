## Multi-Scope Context

When activated, check for scope context:

1. **Session scope**: Look for `.bmad-scope` file in project root
2. **Load context**: If scope is active, load both:
   - Global context: `_bmad-output/_shared/project-context.md`
   - Scope context: `_bmad-output/{scope}/project-context.md` (if exists)
3. **Merge contexts**: Scope-specific context extends/overrides global
4. **Menu items with `scope_required: true`**: Prompt for scope before executing

For menu items that produce artifacts, ensure they go to the active scope's directory.
